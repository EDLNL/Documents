File-share in Azure/Sharepoint?

How are we going to show the data for the traders, and how are the traders putting in new input? (Talk to Cloud Solution Architect and data specialist)

How do we control user access to Azure SQL database.

Should we use Azure active directory? Should we use our own domain, to avoid delays for IT-Operation?

Where are we going to deploy Docker containers.

Application logging in Azure. (Log Analytics, Azure Files or etc.)

Should we use common storage
